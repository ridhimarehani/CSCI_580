# CSCI_580
CSCI_580 HW2:
Rendering a Teapot -
Teapot.json contains the triangle data for the Teapot.
Each triangle contains three verts' data, one vert per line. For each vert, you get: x y z nx ny nz u v.
Here (x,y,z) is the vert's co-ordinate, (nx,ny,nz) is its normal vector, and (u,v) is its "texture coordinate" (to fetch a color from an image, for ex). For this HW, you don't need to use (u,v)
